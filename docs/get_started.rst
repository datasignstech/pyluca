===========

pyluca is built by a financial institution that lets you set up a double-entry accounting system (DEAS) for any purpose. Assuming the readers know about what is DEAS, the building blocks of the system are Accounts, Journal Entries, Ledger & Journals, etc.

Before going deep, run the following install command

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/datasignstech/pyluca
